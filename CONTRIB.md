How to View as a GitBook
========================

1. Get a [gitbook](www.gitbook.com) acount.
2. Contact izzycecil, and he will add you into the book.
3. Done!

However, you don't need this feature at all while contributing to the
book. You can simply use your editor of choice, and use a normal
branch-based workflow.

Do be sure that when you use the gibook editor, you are not working on
the master branch. Pull requests are still going to be used as a
chance for peer review.

Adding Content to the Book
==========================
Whenever you wish to add content, simply make a new branch, add the
content, and submit a pull request on github. This will give everyone
a chance to review changes before they are made. You might want to be
sure that your work is not overlapping with anyone else --- be sure to
communicate!

Rules and Guidlines
===================
For the time being, everything will done in markdown. In order to use
latex,

> When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$
> and they are
> $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Be sure to restrict your lines to 80 characters. This will make git
diffs easier to deal with, as well as allow me to not change my ways.
